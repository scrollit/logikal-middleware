    <!-- Sales Order Line Form View Enhancement - REMOVED -->
    <!-- The sale.view_order_line_form doesn't exist in Odoo 18, and since sales order lines
         are typically edited inline within the sales order, this separate form enhancement
         is not critical for the main functionality. -->

    <!-- Sales Order Line List View (within Sales Order) Enhancement - REMOVED -->
    <!-- The sale.view_order_line_tree2 doesn't exist in Odoo 18. This was intended to add
         visual indicators to the embedded sales order line list within the sales order form.
         The main functionality works through the sales order interface. -->
