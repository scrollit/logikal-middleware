# Session Isolation Issue - Project Persistence Problem

## Problem Summary

**Issue**: Projects are being processed and committed successfully during sync operations, but they are not persisting in the database after the operation completes.

**Root Cause**: Session isolation issue where FastAPI's `get_db` dependency closes the session in a `finally` block, causing SQLAlchemy to rollback uncommitted changes despite explicit `commit()` calls.

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Framework**: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Session Management**: FastAPI dependency injection with `get_db()`
- **Transaction Management**: Manual commits in service methods

### Flow
1. API endpoint `/api/v1/sync/projects` uses `Depends(get_db)`
2. `SyncService` is initialized with the session
3. `ProjectSyncService.sync_all_projects()` processes projects
4. Projects are added and committed successfully (logs show success)
5. Session is closed by FastAPI dependency injection
6. Projects disappear from database

### Evidence
- ✅ Projects are detected and processed (3 projects)
- ✅ All commits are logged as successful
- ✅ No errors or rollbacks in logs
- ❌ Projects are not in database after sync completes

## Files Included

1. **database.py** - Database configuration and session management
2. **sync_service.py** - Main sync orchestrator
3. **project_sync_service.py** - Project sync implementation
4. **sync_router.py** - API endpoint definition
5. **sync_logs.txt** - Complete sync operation logs
6. **database_schema.sql** - Database schema for projects table
7. **test_script.py** - Standalone test to reproduce the issue
8. **docker-compose.yml** - Environment configuration

## Reproducing the Issue

1. Run the sync endpoint: `POST /api/v1/sync/projects`
2. Monitor logs for successful commits
3. Check database - projects will be missing
4. Run the test script to isolate the session issue

## Key Questions for External Service

1. Why does SQLAlchemy session.close() rollback committed changes?
2. How to properly manage transactions with FastAPI dependency injection?
3. Should we use a different session management pattern?
4. Is there a way to ensure commits persist after session closure?

## Environment
- Python 3.9+
- FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy 1.4+
- PostgreSQL 13+
- Docker containers
